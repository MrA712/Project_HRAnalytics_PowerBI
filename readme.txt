Welcome to my Power BI project on HR Attrition data analysis!
In this project, I have used Power BI to analyze and visualize HR data to identify the factors that contribute to employee attrition. This Read Me file provides a brief overview of the project, including its purpose, data sources, and key features.

=========
Purpose:
